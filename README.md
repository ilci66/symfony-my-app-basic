# My Symfony App

## Project Description
Trying to make a simple shopping website using symfony

### Project Motivation
As I'm trying to learn a whole new stack (react-symfony-nginx-mysql) and technologies right now, there is 
no better way of learning than actually doing. I want to also dockerize this app next steps after I'm sure 
I know how symfony works. Reading and searching for best practices as I go.

### Technology Used, To Be Used
*   React
*   Symfony
*   Nginx
*   Docker
*   Mysql
