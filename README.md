# My Symfony App

## Project Description
Trying to make a simple shopping website using symfony

### Project Motivation
As I'm trying to learn a whole new stack (react-symfony-nginx-mysql) and technologies right now, there is 
no better way of learning than actually doing. I want to also dockerize this app next steps after I'm sure 
I know how symfony works. Reading and searching for best practices as I go.

### Technology Used, To Be Used
*   React
*   Symfony
*   Nginx
*   Docker
*   Mysql

### Currently Working On
As I don't have much experience with symfony and twig template engine yet, I'm making sure that I understand all the basics of symfony beofre I move on to including other technologies.
