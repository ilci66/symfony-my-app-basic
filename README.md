# My Symfony App

## Project Description
Practicing what I have learned so far from videos and docs about symfony.

### Project Motivation
As I'm trying to learn a whole new stack (react-symfony-nginx-mysql) and technologies right now, there is 
no better way of learning than actually doing. 

### Technology Used, To Be Used
*   Symfony

### Currently Working On
As I don't have much experience with symfony and twig template engine yet, I'm making sure that I understand all the basics of symfony before I move on to including other technologies to my symfony applications.
